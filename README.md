# 1. Important Information <a id="one" />
Welcome to ASM NGS 2022! We are back with an in-person meeting this year. 

As in years past, we're trying to make this conference as **open, accessible, and user-friendly** as possible in the interest of open science. This repo will store slides, posters, and notes from the conference from those participants who are up for sharing their material, and it will also serve as another mechanism to receive realtime feedback in the form of issues (check [this out](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) if you're unsure how to create an issue).

The [conference website](https://www.asm.org/Events/ASM-NGS/Home) contains all sorts of useful information, and if you're tweeting, gramming, tiktoking, or whatever, please use the hashtag **[#ASMNGS](https://www.twitter.com/search?q=%23ASMNGS&src=typed_query)**. You can tag **[@ASMicrobiology](https://www.twitter.com/ASMicrobiology)** too.

If you need to get in touch with the organizers at any time, you have multiple options. You can tweet at or email this year's meeting chairs – **Ruth Timme ([twitter](http://www.twitter.com/doctorruth) | [email](mailto:ruth.timme@fda.hhs.gov)) and Elodie Ghedin ([twitter](http://www.twitter.com/@eghedin) | [email](mailto:elodie.ghedin@nih.gov)).**  You can also open a new issue in this repo, or you can contact the wonderful ASM Conferences team through the meeting website.

# 3. Code of Conduct <a id="three" />
ASM and the ASMNGS team is committed to providing an environment that encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas and promotes equal opportunities and respectful treatment for all participants. All participants are expected to treat others with respect and consideration, follow venue rules, and alert ASM staff or security of any dangerous situations or anyone in distress.

ASM prohibits and will not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying at its events. Harassment is unwanted and unwelcome attention or other conduct that creates an environment where a reasonable person would feel unwelcome, intimidated, excluded, or abused. Harassment based on gender, race, religion, national origin, age, marital status, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, family responsibilities, genetic information, disability, matriculation, political affiliation, and any other personal characteristic is strictly prohibited.

ASM will investigate all complaints of harassment, and investigations will be conducted in an unbiased manner. Violation of this code of conduct may result in the participant being asked to leave the event at which the incident occurred, without warning or refund; being barred from attending ASM events in the future; and, if relevant, being barred from or revocation of membership in the ASM. Event security and local police may be contacted in the event violators pose an imminent threat to others or are disrupting the event. If an ASM Staff member is found to be in violation, the ASM Headquarters Employment Policy (Prohibition against Sexual and Other Harassment and Discrimination) will be followed. Action regarding an ASM staff member may result in termination of employment.

This policy applies to all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, contractors, volunteers, and guests at ASM events. If a participant experiences or witnesses harassment, he/she should contact ASM staff (ASM staff are identifiable by their ASM Staff name badge) as soon as possible or contact security if they feel unsafe. All complaints will be responded to promptly and treated seriously and, to the extent possible, confidentially. Complaints that require broader investigation will be handled by ASM’s Ethics Committee. ASM expressly forbids any retaliation against individuals for reporting harassment.

In the event that an individual knowingly provides false information regarding a harassment situation, ASM may take similar disciplinary action.

If a participant experiences or witnesses harassment as described in ASM’s Events Code of Conduct, they should contact ASM staff (identifiable by ASM staff badge) to report the incident. If at any time a participant feels unsafe, they should contact meeting venue security immediately. If the participant is unsure that the incident was in violation of the ASM’s Events Code of Conduct, they may inquire first from an ASM staff member before filing a formal complaint.

The following information should be provided when reporting a harassment incident:
- Name and contact information of participant
- Name and contact information of any witnesses
- Identifying information (e.g. name, badge number, physical appearance) of the individual(s) who are accused of the harassment
- The specific action or behavior that was in violation of the ASM Events Code of Conduct
- The date and approximate time of the incident
- The location and circumstances surrounding the incident

ASM will accept and investigate all complaints of harassment and investigations will be conducted in an unbiased manner. All complaints will be responded to promptly and treated seriously and, to the extent possible, confidentially.

**Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all!**

# 4. Live Notes <a id="four" />
Live notes have been an important ASM NGS for the past several meetings. For ASMNGS17 and 18, we used Mozilla's EtherPad platform, and unfortunately, I suspect that the notes were lost when Mozilla shuttered the platform in 2018. This time, we'll try Google Docs.  The link to the ASMNGS20 collaborative live notes doc is right [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l-661diBpJLinWP7Xyb8Jzc-qUvd54ddqARtz7KaJKs/edit?usp=sharing). I have no idea how well this will work in an asynchronous virtual conference, but jump in and start contributing if you want to!

# 6. ASM NGS Hackathon <a id="six" />
## December 2-4, 2020 (0900-1200h GMT-5 all three days)
This year, [Boas van der Putten](https://twitter.com/boasvdputten) and [Lee Katz](https://www.twitter.com/lskatz) are organizing what looks to be a wonderful ASM NGS Hackathon.

This year's objective is unit testing.  Participants will learn by experience: unit testing, continuous integration, GitHub Actions, and everything else that goes with git.

In other words, each team will take on the task of choosing a bioinformatics software package, testing it in a standardized way, and reporting back to the group.  A finished unit test will be represented by a shiny green badge on our site, indicating that the software works (or a red badge of shame if it doesn't).  If successful, the site will serve as a certification that any given bioinformatics software works (or doesn't).

If interested in participating, please sign up here: https://forms.gle/rSSkQZv3pZXEAh3a7!  

After signing up, please form teams via pull requests here: https://github.com/microbinfie-hackathon2020/CSIS/blob/main/TEAMS.md.

More information and the hackathon base of operations can be found here: https://github.com/microbinfie-hackathon2020/CSIS

### INCREDIBLE WORK ON THE HACKATHON THIS YEAR!
> Four teams developed unit tests and validation for common bioinformatic tools and workflows. *Team Chewbbaca*, *Team SARS-CoV-2*, *Team All-The-Krakens* and *Team Assembly* brought together dozens of beautiful nerds from across four (five?) continents! Running the hackathon was a learning experience, and all four teams made some really amazing hacks!

**CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THAT PARTICIPATED, AND WE HOPE THAT THE HACKING CONTINUES ON!**

# 7. About ASMNGS <a id="seven" />
ASMNGS began in 2015 (if you're feeling nostalgic, the program is available [here](https://www.asm.org/images/ngsfinalprogram.pdf)), organized by Dag Harmsen (University of Muenster), Marc Allard (FDA), and Eric Brown (FDA). In 2017, the program committee was co-chaired by Dag and Jennifer Gardy (BCCDC), and also included Marc, Eric, and new committee members Elodie Ghedin (NYU),  Paul Keim (TGen), Duncan MacCannell (CDC), Adam Phillippy (NHGRI). In order to both coincide with the GenomeTrakr annual meeting and to not conflict with ABPHM, the committee decided to move the meeting to even years beginning in 2018. Also in 2018, Ruth Timme (FDA) replaced Eric Brown on the organizing committee and the 2020 planning committee grew to include George Gthinji, Torsten Seemann, and Sofonias Tessema.

Keynote speakers were selected by soliciting ideas from the organizing committee, who then arrived at our top choices through an email discussion. Submitted abstracts were reviewed by Ruth and Duncan - 149 were accepted, and 10 were declined. Reasons for declining abstracts included a topic not consistent with the conference's scope, or inadequate/inappropriate/insufficient methods/results/conclusions. All accepted abstracts were reviewed by the organizing committee, and six committee members cast votes for that they felt merited oral presentation. Votes were tallied, and abstracts selected for oral presentation accordingly. We also looked for diversity in our presenters, to ensure that ASM NGS continues to represent the full breadth, brightness and potential of our field.

Subsidized registration for participants from low and middle income countries (LMICs) is thanks to generous support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. You can apply for a subsidy [here](https://asmeetings.formstack.com/forms/2020_asm_ngs__bmgf_lmic_registration_subsidy), or see if you are [eligible](https://data.worldbank.org/income-level/low-and-middle-income).

We are grateful to all of our corporate [sponsors](https://asm.org/Events/ASM-NGS/Sponsorship-Opportunities) this year, and look forward to a great conference.
